## Linux Architecture (Easy Explanation)

---

### (a) Hardware Layer

- Hardware means the physical parts of a computer:
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Hard Disk
  - Network Card
- The OS communicates with hardware using *device drivers*

---

### (b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

- The *Linux Kernel* is the heart of the operating system
- It connects software with hardware

####  Main Functions:

- *Process Management* → Handles running programs and multitasking  
- *Memory Management* → Uses RAM efficiently  
- *Device Drivers* → Communication with hardware  
- *File System Management* → Organizes data storage  
- *Network Management* → Handles networking  

---

### (c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

- The *Shell* allows users to interact with the system using commands  
- Acts as a bridge between *user ↔ kernel*

####  Examples:
- Bash  
- Zsh  
- Fish  
- Dash  
- Ksh  

 Converts user commands into instructions for the kernel

---

### 🔹 (d) System Libraries & Utilities

- *System Libraries*:
  - glibc
  - libc  
   Provide ready-made functions for programs  

- *System Utilities*:
  - ls  
  - grep  
  - systemctl  
   Used for daily tasks  

---

###  (e) User Applications

- Programs used by users:

  - Text Editors → Vim, Nano  
  - Web Servers → Apache  
  - DevOps Tools → Docker  

 Applications interact with OS using system calls

##  Key Points to Remember

- *Kernel* → Core of Linux  
- *Shell* → Interface between user and kernel  
- *Libraries & Utilities* → Support system  
- *Applications* → What users use  
- *Hardware* → Physical components
